            'When building a new digital product, selecting a technology stack may be a daunting task. There are a plethora of options to choose from. Don\'t worry, I have got you covered. Almost every technology is usable or viable in most cases. These four tips will help you choose the best technology you need for your requirements.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'The first thing you might want to consider is the **PURPOSE**. What do you want to build? Is it a prototype, which allows you to quickly verify your business assumptions? This is when you would like to choose the technology that will allow you to verify your assumptions in the market. On the other hand, if you want to build an already working application or are not looking to rebuild from scratch to meet different kinds of goals, you might want to choose a different technology, which is the most resilient one. The one that will allow you to build, maybe even enterprise-class software.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'The second tip you should consider is the **USE CASE**. If you are building an application that relies heavily on machine learning or data science, then you would want to choose Python or some of the frameworks that work with Python. Or maybe you are looking to build a general-purpose platform. If that is the case, you may choose from different languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. There will be some small details that will guide you toward one technology over another.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'The third thing is the **ARCHITECTURE**. In most cases, new applications are built as a monolith, meaning that there are different functionalities under one application. If you want to build a large-scale application or service that will need various functionalities, you might want to consider going with microservices. In that case, your choices will be based on specific pieces of the application\'s functionalities, and you will have multiple technology stacks for different purposes.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'And lastly, it is the **POPULARITY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT**. Whether the technology is popular determines if you will have access to specialists and communities that know this technology. What is also very important regarding popularity is the use cases where someone or organisation has already used that technology for a similar purpose. Additionally, you will have access to many libraries that allow you to build different aspects of your application.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'You may also consider building a proof of concept. Sometimes, building a prototype and measuring specific parameters will give you the best answers to your questions. Establish the requirements, define the goals you want to meet, create a solution that will allow you to do that, and measure its success.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'I believe this article will help you if you are stuck and provide a better understanding of choosing the best technology stacks for your projects.\n'
